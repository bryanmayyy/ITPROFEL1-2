            <h1>About Dogs</h1>
            <h2>The dog is a pet animal. A dog has sharp teeth so that it can eat flesh very easily. It is a very clever animal and is very useful in catching thieves. It runs very fast, barks loudly and attacks the strangers.What is special about dogs?
                Their Loyalty Knows No Bounds. With a history of companionship as long as the one between dogs and humans, it's no wonder the pet-owner relationship is one that's so strong.These clever canines have an incredible sense of smell â€“ allowing them to follow scent trails days after they were left. Amazingly, bloodhounds' sense of smell is so spot on that it can be used as evidence in court.</h2>
